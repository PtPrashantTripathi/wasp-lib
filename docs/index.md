## The Problem: Manual WASM Memory is Hard

Working directly with WebAssembly memory from JavaScript is powerful but fraught
with challenges like memory leaks, a lack of type safety, and repetitive
boilerplate code.

### Before wasp-lib ðŸ˜°

```typescript
// Manual memory management - error-prone and verbose!
function processData(wasm: any, numbers: number[]) {
    // Allocate memory manually
    const arraySize = numbers.length * 4; // 4 bytes per i32
    const arrayPtr = wasm._malloc(arraySize);

    // Copy data byte by byte
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        wasm.setValue(arrayPtr + i * 4, numbers[i], "i32");
    }

    // Call WASM function
    const sum = wasm._sum_array(arrayPtr, numbers.length);

    // Read result and manually free memory
    wasm._free(arrayPtr); // Easy to forget!

    return sum;
}
```

## The Solution: Simple & Safe Abstractions

`wasp-lib` provides intuitive wrapper classes that handle the messy parts of
memory management for you, so you can focus on your application logic.

### After wasp-lib ðŸŽ‰

```typescript
// Clean, type-safe, automatic cleanup!
import { ArrayPointer, WASMModule } from "wasp-lib";

function processData(wasm: WASMModule, numbers: number[]) {
    const arrayPtr = ArrayPointer.from(wasm, "i32", numbers.length, numbers);
    const sum = wasm._sum_array(arrayPtr.ptr, numbers.length);

    // Use readAndFree() for automatic cleanup or free() manually
    arrayPtr.free();

    return sum;
}
```
